 Hand Gesture Controlled Servo Motor using Computer Vision and Arduino Uno
This project demonstrates the use of computer vision to control a servo motor through hand gestures. The system leverages a Python program on a PC to recognize hand gestures and sends corresponding commands to an Arduino Uno via serial communication. The Arduino Uno then translates these commands into servo motor movements, allowing for a seamless interaction between the PC and hardware components.
